The time series suggests two states with different carrying capacities: From 1953-1968 and 1987 - 2005, K ~ 12e9 individuals, but from 1969 - 1986, K ~ 2e9 individuals. The authors discuss the 'resistance' of the lower K state to transition towards the higher K state, and suggest that overfishing may stabilize the lower K state. A model with high natural morality and low recruitment is thought to really prevent the transition to the higher K state (desirable from a fishing magement perspective). Take home message: Most fisheries magement assumes that a single stable state exists, with a single carry capacity. The oyster fishery in New Jersey may exhibit two states, with different Kês. Ideally, magement would want to •pushê the system into the higher K state, but current overfishing may •lockê the system into the lower K state. High rates of tural mortality and low recruitment may contribute to hysteresis. It is worth noting that this modeling exercise is based on a time series that exhibits the low K state, then the high K state, and then low state. SoÄnot much replication. Also, from a strict stable states perspective, it is not clear that there wasnêt a shift in the abiotic conditions (which would not make it ASS).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mangrove,"Bosire, Aquatic Botany, 2008.
