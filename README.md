## FIGURE 3 - decision rules

#### Fig 3A
Expert examples - response to the question:
Have you encountered instances of notable resilience?  
Filtering steps
 1. 97 respondents to start
 2. Remove non-climate disturbances; 71 remaining

#### Fig 3B
Literature examples
 1. Start with 131 suggested papers - called 'litOrig' (131 rows).  
 2. Removed 1 paper that could not be found (130)
 3. Removed 43 papers that were not relevant to the resilience question (87)
 4. Removed 0 papers that were on restoration (87)
 This dataset is called 'litFull' 
 5. Including only habitat forming species and whole community (70) 
 6. Including only climatic disturbances (55) - called 'litSub'


## FIGURE 4 - decision rules
Fig 4A, B, C - promoting resilience; D, E - preventing resilience

#### Fig 4A
What factors promote resilience? Used respondents in survey that did 
observe at least one instance of resilience.

Filtering steps
 1. 97 respondents to start
 2. Remove non-climate disturbances; 71 remaining
 3. Some respondents gave more than one factor promoting resilience; 
 each of these were counted separately.
 4. Collating both factors into one column resulted in a dataframe with 
 73 rows (some respondents gave no factors promoting resilience)
 
#### Fig 4B
Expert opinions. 
Calculated percentage of 'very important' responses for resistance and recovery separately.  
Used Jen's summary.  

#### Fig 4C
Literature examples
Follow decision rules for Fig 3B, start with litSub (55)
 1. Remove papers without evidence of resilience (46)
 2. Remove one paper without a factor promoting resilience (45)
 3. Some papers gave more than one factor promoting resilience; 
 each of these were counted separately.
 4. Collating both factors into one column (67)

#### Fig 4D
Expert opinions. 
Used all data.

#### Fig 4E
Literature examples - resume after step 2 from Fig 4C (46)
 1. Collated both factors preventing resilience into one column (49)
