## FIGURE 3 - decision rules

#### Fig 3A
Expert examples - response to the question:
Have you encountered instances of notable resilience?  
Filtering steps
 1. 97 respondents to start
 2. Remove non-climate disturbances; 71 remaining

#### Fig 3B
Literature examples
 1. Start with 131 suggested papers (rows).  
 2. Removed 4, where paper could not be found (127). 
 3. Removed 28, where paper was not relevant to the resilience question (90)
 4. Removed 1, where paper did not give a ResilienceResponse group 
 (e.g., habitat forming species). So, full lit dataset has 89 rows.  
 5. Including only habitat forming species and whole community - down to 74 rows. 
 6. Including only climatic disturbances, down to 60 rows.  
(Did not remove restoration)


## FIGURE 4 - decision rules

Fig 4A, B, C - promoting resilience; D, E - preventing resilience

Restoration was reclassified as management.  

4A - expert examples.  
# Decision tree
# Factors promoting resilience - expert examples
# Start with 97 rows (respondents)
# Remove 30 respondents who did not observe resilience; 67 rows
# Remove 3 respondents who did not give a factor1 for resilience; 64 rows
# Combined two listed factors; 81 rows
# Removed non-climate disturbances; 71 rows

4B - expert opinions. 
Calculated percentage of 'very important' responses for resistance and recovery separately.  
Used Jen's summary.  

4C - expert papers
# Filtering steps
# 98 papers to start
# Remove papers without evidence of resilience; 75
# Remove rows that are blank for promoteFactor1; 55
# Combine columns for factor1 and factor2; 78
# Select habitat formers; 68
# Select climate disturbances; 50 remaining

4D - expert opinions
Started with 97 rows.  calculated percentages for very important responses - from raw data.  

4E - expert papers
# Filtering steps
# 98 papers to start
# Remove papers without evidence of resilience; 75
# Remove rows that are blank for preventFactor1; 46
# Combine columns for factor1 and factor2; 53
# Select habitat formers; 48
# Select climate disturbances; 34 remaining
