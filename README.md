## FIGURE 3 - decision rules

#### Fig 3A
Expert examples - response to the question:
Have you encountered instances of notable resilience?  
Filtering steps
 1. 97 respondents to start
 2. Remove non-climate disturbances; 71 remaining

#### Fig 3B
Literature examples
 1. Start with 131 suggested papers - called 'litOrig' (131 rows).  
 2. Removed 1 paper that could not be found (130)
 3. Removed 43 papers that were not relevant to the resilience question (87)
 4. Removed 0 papers that were on restoration (87)
 This dataset is called 'litFull' 
 5. Including only habitat forming species and whole community (70) 
 6. Including only climatic disturbances (55) - called 'litSub'


## FIGURE 4 - decision rules

Fig 4A, B, C - promoting resilience; D, E - preventing resilience

Restoration was reclassified as management.  

4A - expert examples.  
# Decision tree
# Factors promoting resilience - expert examples
# Start with 97 rows (respondents)
# Remove 30 respondents who did not observe resilience; 67 rows
# Remove 3 respondents who did not give a factor1 for resilience; 64 rows
# Combined two listed factors; 81 rows
# Removed non-climate disturbances; 71 rows

4B - expert opinions. 
Calculated percentage of 'very important' responses for resistance and recovery separately.  
Used Jen's summary.  

4C - expert papers
# Filtering steps
# 98 papers to start
# Remove papers without evidence of resilience; 75
# Remove rows that are blank for promoteFactor1; 55
# Combine columns for factor1 and factor2; 78
# Select habitat formers; 68
# Select climate disturbances; 50 remaining

4D - expert opinions
Started with 97 rows.  calculated percentages for very important responses - from raw data.  

4E - expert papers
# Filtering steps
# 98 papers to start
# Remove papers without evidence of resilience; 75
# Remove rows that are blank for preventFactor1; 46
# Combine columns for factor1 and factor2; 53
# Select habitat formers; 48
# Select climate disturbances; 34 remaining
